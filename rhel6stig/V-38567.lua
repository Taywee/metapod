Then, for each setuid / setgid program on the system, add a line of the following form to "/etc/audit/audit.rules", where [SETUID_PROG_PATH] is the full path to each setuid / setgid program in the list:

$ sudo grep path /etc/audit/audit.rules

It should be the case that all relevant setuid / setgid programs have a line in the audit rules. If that is not the case, this is a finding.]=]
